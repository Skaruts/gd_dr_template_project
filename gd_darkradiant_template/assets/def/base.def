Mins/Maxs are only applied if the 'clipmodel' is empty/invalid and 'noclipmodel' is not set to 1. Mins defines the 'lower right' corner of the rectangular clipmodel bounds, measured from the entity's origin. Note that this will prevent the code from load a clipmodel from the visual mesh."

Mins/Maxs are only applied if the 'clipmodel' is empty/invalid and 'noclipmodel' is not set to 1. Maxs defines the 'upper left' corner of the rectangular clipmodel bounds, measured from the entity's origin. Note that this will prevent the code from load a clipmodel from the visual mesh."

	"editor_model clipmodel"				"The 'clipmodel' spawnarg can be used to define which model file should be used as collision mesh for this entity. A collision mesh must be very simple in terms of geometry and must not exceed certain poly/edge/vertex limits. If the 'clipmodel' spawnarg is missing or invalid, the code will either attempt to generate a simple one with 'mins'/'maxs'/'size' or to retrieve a clipmodel from the visual mesh as defined in 'model' (in this order), but only if 'noclipmodel' is '0'."
	"editor_bool noclipmodel"				"When this is set to '1' (default is '0'), the code will not attempt to generate a clipmodel for this entity or to create one from its visual model (see 'model' spawnarg). This is only effective if 'clipmodel' is empty/invalid, as this spawnarg cannot be used to override a valid 'clipmodel' spawnarg (the latter will still create a valid clipmodel even if 'noclipmodel' is set to '1')."
